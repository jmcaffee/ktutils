# Ktutils

Handy utility methods I use in my Ruby code (and wheels I've reinvented)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ktutils'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ktutils

## Usage

To pull everything into your code

    require 'ktutils'

You probably don't want to pull in everything at once, you'll only need one
or two modules/classes at a time.

    require 'ktutils/os'

## Utilities

### OS Detection

    require 'ktutils/os'
